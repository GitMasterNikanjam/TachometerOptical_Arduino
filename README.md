# TachometerOptical Library for Arduino 

- This library can used for optical tachometers apllications. eg: Motor RPM measurement.  
- The main class is **RPM**. 
- Max 3 number optical RPM object can create from RPM class at the same time.   
- Each RPM object has its own digital pin number for signal interrupts.
